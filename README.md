# Asteroid Shooter

An experiment to get familiar with Pixijs.

Play it [here](https://lukecarlthompson.github.io/Pixijs-Space-Shooter/).

## Using the game

Just visit the game url using Chrome or Firefox. Runs best in Chrome, ok in Firefox and barely at all in Safari.

Use the mouse to control direction your spaceship and left mouse button to shoot.

Press the spacebar to activate the thruster and move forward.

Shoot as many asteroids as you can. Don't worry they can't hurt you just yet. Be careful not to fly off the screen because there are no game bounds implemented and you might just get lost forever.
